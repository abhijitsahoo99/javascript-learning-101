JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, 
Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, 
imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

just-in-time(JIT) - JavaScript is an interpreted programming language, meaning that the code is executed by an interpreter line by line,
translating and executing each statement as it encounters them. This approach provides flexibility but can be slower compared to 
languages that are compiled ahead of time.
However, modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 (used in Google Chrome) or SpiderMonkey (used in Mozilla Firefox), employ a JIT compiler 
to optimize the execution of JavaScript code. The JIT compiler dynamically compiles parts of the JavaScript code into a more efficient 
machine code just before it is executed. This contrasts with traditional interpreters, which directly interpret the source code without 
any intermediate compilation step.

The JIT compilation process allows JavaScript engines to strike a balance between the flexibility of an interpreted language and the
performance of a compiled language. By dynamically compiling and optimizing the code, JIT engines can significantly speed up JavaScript
execution, making it comparable to or even faster than some traditionally compiled languages in certain scenarios.
